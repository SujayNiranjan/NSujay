# My Projects

Below are some of the key projects I've worked on in robotics, perception, and 3D mapping:

## 1. [MappingNYC](projects/mappingnyc/index.md)
**Description:**  
MappingNYC is a project where I contributed to developing a multimodal dataset of New York City's street views for autonomous vehicle navigation. This dataset includes 3D point clouds, RGB images, and GPS data, which are essential for improving the accuracy of autonomous systems in urban environments.

**Key Technologies Used:**
- LiDAR
- ROS
- Visual SLAM
- 3D Gaussian Splatting
- Colmap

## 2. [SwimmerBot](projects/swimmerbot/index.md)
**Description:**  
SwimmerBot is a robotic system designed to track swimmers in a pool, filming their movements for performance analysis. This project integrates a robot with AI and computer vision to create an autonomous system capable of following swimmers across the pool.

**Key Technologies Used:**
- Robot Design and Control
- Object Detection
- Real-Time Tracking
- ROS2

## 3. [UrbanNav](projects/urbannav/index.md)
**Description:**  
UrbanNav focuses on training navigation models using data from a robot dog equipped with LiDAR, a 360 camera, and GPS. The goal is to enable autonomous navigation using advanced machine learning algorithms to help the robot understand and navigate complex urban environments.

**Key Technologies Used:**
- NoMaD (Goal Masked Diffusion)
- GNM (Goal-Conditioned Navigation Models)
- ViNT (Vision-based Transformer for Navigation Tasks)
- LiDAR and 360 Cameras

## 4. [Curb2Door](projects/curb2door/index.md)
**Description:**  
The Curb2Door project is focused on creating a 3D point cloud map of environments using a custom sensor mount. This projectâ€™s goal is to optimize last-mile delivery solutions by reconstructing environments with precision, aiding robots in navigating complex spaces.

**Key Technologies Used:**
- LiDAR
- 3D Gaussian Splatting
- R3LIVE Algorithm
- GPS Integration
