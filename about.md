# About Me

I am a robotics researcher currently interning at the AI4CE Lab at NYU, where I focus on advancing robotic perception and 3D mapping techniques. I completed my Master's in Mechatronics and Robotics from NYU and my Bachelor's in Robotics and Automation from Jain University.

## My Passion

What motivates me is the potential to create intelligent machines that can think and interact in the world. The idea of developing robots that can adapt to their environments and collaborate with humans excites me every day.

In addition to my research, I am passionate about mentoring students and contributing to STEM education, especially in robotics. I have mentored teams for national robotics competitions, helping them achieve great success.

## Technical Skills:
- Python, C, ROS, MATLAB
- 3D Mapping & SLAM
- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
