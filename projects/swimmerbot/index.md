# SwimmerBot

## **Project Overview**
SwimmerBot is a robot designed to autonomously track swimmers in a pool, following them while filming underwater. The project focuses on creating a robust tracking system using computer vision and sensor fusion.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Hardware**: Custom-built robot, cameras, GPS
- **Software**: OpenCV, ROS, Sensor Fusion

### **Key Contributions**
1. Developed an autonomous tracking system to follow swimmers across the pool.
2. Integrated sensors (GPS, IMU) for accurate positioning and movement tracking.
3. Implemented computer vision algorithms to ensure accurate tracking of swimmers.

### **Outcomes**
- A fully autonomous system capable of tracking and filming swimmers.
- Provided a novel approach to training and competition analysis for swimmers.
