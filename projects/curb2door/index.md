# Curb2Door

## **Project Overview**
Curb2Door involves creating detailed 3D maps for urban delivery systems, focusing on curbside and door-to-door routes. The project utilizes advanced sensor fusion techniques to reconstruct city environments and optimize delivery logistics.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Hardware**: Livox LiDAR, Insta360 camera, u-blox GPS
- **Software**: 3D Gaussian Splatting, R3LIVE, SLAM algorithms

### **Key Contributions**
1. Developed a mount system integrating LiDAR and cameras for efficient data capture.
2. Implemented **3D Gaussian Splatting** for efficient point cloud reconstruction.
3. Used **R3LIVE** for real-time 3D reconstruction.

### **Outcomes**
- Generated highly accurate 3D models of urban areas for delivery optimization.
- Improved mapping techniques for better route planning and autonomous navigation.
