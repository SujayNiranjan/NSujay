# Diffusion Models for Trajectory Prediction

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on predicting a person's future trajectory using diffusion models. By analyzing historical movement data, the system forecasts the likely paths that people will take in future frames.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Machine Learning**: Diffusion Models
- **Programming Languages**: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Algorithms**: Trajectory Prediction

### **Key Contributions**
1. Developed and trained a diffusion model to predict trajectories based on past movements.
2. Implemented state-of-the-art techniques in machine learning to improve prediction accuracy.

### **Outcomes**
- Enhanced trajectory prediction models for use in autonomous vehicles and robotics.
- Demonstrated successful predictions in real-world scenarios, improving robotic navigation and planning.
