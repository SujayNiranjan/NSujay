# Biped Robot Development

## **Project Overview**
This project involved designing a biped robot with eight degrees of freedom, integrating motor control and sensory feedback to enhance movement and gait stability.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Hardware**: Custom-built biped robot, IMU sensors, motors
- **Software**: MATLAB, ROS, Motor Control Algorithms

### **Key Contributions**
1. Designed and built a biped robot capable of walking and maintaining balance.
2. Integrated sensory feedback using IMU sensors to optimize movement.
3. Developed control algorithms for smooth and stable gait.

### **Outcomes**
- Successfully created a biped robot capable of walking with improved gait stability.
- Contributed to the field of robotics with advancements in bipedal locomotion.
