        <h1>Research & Projects</h1>

        <p><em>View the <a href="insert your project link here">source of this content</a>.</em></p>

        <p>My research focuses on advancing robotic perception, mapping, and autonomy, with a special interest in sensor fusion, state estimation, and localization for robotic systems. I am currently working on multiple projects that integrate cutting-edge techniques in AI and machine learning to push the boundaries of autonomous systems.</p>

        <p>Some of my notable projects include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="projects/mappingnyc/">MappingNYC</a> - A project involving advanced LiDAR and GPS systems for detailed urban mapping.</li>
          <li><a href="projects/swimmerbot/">SwimmerBot</a> - A robotic swimmer tracker for precise athlete tracking and video recording in aquatic environments.</li>
          <li><a href="projects/urbannav/">UrbanNav</a> - Autonomous navigation using a Unitree Go1 robot dog equipped with various sensors.</li>
          <li><a href="projects/curb2door/">Curb2Door</a> - Optimizing last-mile delivery solutions using 3D point cloud maps.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Publications & Collaborations</h2>
        <p>In addition to my research, I am collaborating with researchers and industry professionals on various projects that aim to solve real-world problems in autonomous systems.</p>

        <h2>Math and Code</h2>
        <p>For those interested in the underlying math and algorithms, my projects rely heavily on sensor fusion, SLAM techniques, and optimization methods. Here's an example of one of my algorithms:</p>

        <pre><code>def robot_navigation_algorithm
  # Your code here
end</code></pre>

        <h2>Educational Contributions</h2>
        <p>I have also contributed to the education and mentoring of students, particularly in the field of robotics. This includes teaching, advising students in competitions, and providing guidance on technical projects.</p>

        <h2>Collaborators & Funding</h2>
        <p>I have collaborated with researchers from various institutions, including NYU Tandon, and I am currently involved in several funded projects.</p>
